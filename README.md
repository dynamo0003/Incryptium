#### A 3D game in the Godot 4 game engine, using 2D projection to display objects in the scene, including some deep learning and large language models and algorithms.

## Idea:
This is my theoretical idea for a masters thesis project. Considering my passion for artistic expression and experience crafting I want to do something interesting by creating a game.  

To make things interesting I also want try my hand at including some forms of machine learning algorithms to improve and enhance the players experience.

## Key points:
#### 1. Style
&nbsp; 2D projection elements in a 3D scene. Generally pixelart and 8-bit artstyle (potential to change).  
&nbsp; Think [Wolfenstein 3D](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2270/Wolfenstein_3D/) and [Classic Doom](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2280/DOOM_1993/).

#### 2. Theme
&nbsp; Dark and moody.

#### 3. Technologies
&nbsp; The Godot 4 engine based on GDscript.  
&nbsp; Machine learning in TensorFlow or PyTorch for Python.

#### 4. Interesting libraries/AddOns
- Concave Mesh Slicer
- Cyclops Level Builder
