#### A 3D game in the Godot 4 game engine, using 2D projection to display objects in the scene. Including some deep learning and large language models and algorithms.

## Idea:
This is my theoretical idea for a masters thessis project. Considering my passion for artistic expression and experience crafting I want to do something interesting by creating a game.  

To make things interesting I also want try my hand at including some forms of machine learning algorithms to improve and enhance the players experience.
